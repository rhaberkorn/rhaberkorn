# Good bye, Github!

In protest of Github's affiliation with Microsoft and their AI strategy, including the unauthorized training of LLMs on their users' repositories, I am leaving Github.
All of my more or less active private projects are now self-hosted at https://git.fmsbw.de/.
All of the corresponding Github repositories have been archived for the time being but may well be deleted later on.

Please note that now the preferred way to interact with my projects (discussions, bug reports, patches) is using [mailing lists](https://git.fmsbw.de/?p=about).

I will continue to use my private Github account only for creating pull requests and tickets for projects that do not accept contributions any other way.
